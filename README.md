# FirefoxCollectionReccomendations
My config reccomendations for the firefox extensions in my collection here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/collections/18378733/i-cant-reeeaaaaaaaaaaadddddd/

Remember, this is my personal favourite, if this is too much for you or you just dont like it thats fine, this is just what i find helps me the most.


Stylus Config can be found in the style.css file (simply paste this into your stylus CSS editor).
