# FirefoxCollectionReccomendations
My config reccomendations for the firefox extensions in my collection here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/collections/18378733/i-cant-reeeaaaaaaaaaaadddddd/

Remember, this is my personal favourite, if this is too much for you or you just dont like it thats fine, this is just what i find helps me the most.

this might not be perfect and may even be hard to read in some websites which already have alot of colour, but thankfully you can choose which websites stylus runs on :3

Stylus Config can be found in the style.css file (simply paste this into your stylus CSS editor).

I made this because the learnOpenGL website is so ridiculously hard to focus on.
